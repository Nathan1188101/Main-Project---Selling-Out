//need to come up with some kind of function for the hamburger button

//try doing something with an event listener maybe? idk if that's what we need, but let's play around with it. (add an event listener to the entire button)
//consider also making a sperate style sheet for it (but maybe not, just a thought)

const hamburger = document.querySelector('.menu-btn');

hamburger.addEventListener('click', function(event){


    //try making a modal pop up in here, just to see if the event listener is even working.
   // modal.style.display = "block"; 

});
